# Hi there 👋

ℹ️ This is Flake - new platform + messenger that made by 2 developers for people as free as possible (yet). We still a little project but we're trying to expand. Also we are trying to take into account for the shortcomings in other platforms and come up with our own features.

🔨 Inspired by projects such as: [Discord](https://discord.com), [Telegram](https://telegram.org) and [Reddit](https://reddit.com).

🤷 We still in alpha-test state, but if you just pay your attention & attention of your friends - we'll be pleased!

👩‍💻 We don't have any docs or something like it right now but we'll publish them when the base of the frontend will be developed.

🍿 What do we eat for breakfast? Hmmm... We are drinking coffee. Much much coffee. :) ~~But if you will donate us we'll be able to eat sth instead of coffee~~

🌐 Languages for communicate us - Russian & English.
